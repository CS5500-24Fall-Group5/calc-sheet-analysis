# Code Analysis for Calc-Sheet

## Overview

Tech Stacks:

* Frontend: `React`
* Backend: `Express (Node.js)`

## Frontend Analysis

## `App.tsx` Analysis

This is the entry point of the project, and handles the top level of  states for routing as well as spreadsheet clients.

### Routing System

This demo uses `window.location.href` to parse URL path and `getDocumentNameFromWindow()` function to dynamically load components/page.

* Simple, but in modern design would much prefer to use **[`React Router`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)** for more efficient and scalable routing management.

* The default route is the `LoginPageComponent`, which is rendered when the URL is `/documents`, and it navigates users to the appropriate document or page after a successful login.

```typescript
function getDocumentNameFromWindow() {
  const href = window.location.href;
  // remove  the protocol 
  const protoEnd = href.indexOf('//');
  // find the beginning of the path
  const pathStart = href.indexOf('/', protoEnd + 2);
  if (pathStart < 0) {
    // there is no path
    return '';
  }
  // get the first part of the path
  const docEnd = href.indexOf('/', pathStart + 1);
  if (docEnd < 0) {
    // there is no other slash
    return href.substring(pathStart + 1);
  }
  // there is a slash
  return href.substring(pathStart + 1, docEnd);
}
```

### State Management

```typescript
const [documentName, setDocumentName] = useState(getDocumentNameFromWindow());
useEffect(() => {
  if (window.location.href) {
    setDocumentName(getDocumentNameFromWindow());
  }
}, [getDocumentNameFromWindow]);
```

* Uses React `useState` and `useEffect` at the top level to pass on state down to the components, such as the `documentName`.

* The `useEffect` hook then watches the `documentName` as dependencies and updates component/page when documentName gets changed

* `LoginPageComponent` receives `spreadSheetClient` as a prop to handle user interactions and backend communication related to authentication and document access.

* `SpreadSheet` component receives `documentName` and `spreadSheetClient` as props to manage the specific document and backend communication.

## `LoginPageComponent` Analysis

This component is responsible for handling the actual login process and displaying a list of documents for the user to select and edit once logged in.

### State Management within Login

* `userName`: Stores the logged-in username, which is initialized from `window.sessionStorage`. This ensures that the username is persisted across page reloads.

* `documents`: An array of document names fetched from the server, stored and displayed to the user.

### Polling Mechanism

* The use of `setInterval` in the useEffect hook is used to poll for available documents from the `spreadSheetClient` every 50 milliseconds. When documents are fetched, they are stored in the documents state.

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    const sheets = spreadSheetClient.getSheets();
    if (sheets.length > 0) {
      setDocuments(sheets);
    }
  }, 50);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
});
```

### Login and Logout

* **Login Mechanism:** The login is handled via an input field where the user enters their name and presses "Enter". The username is stored in `sessionStorage` and the `spreadSheetClient` object is updated with the username.

* **Logout Mechanism:** When the user logs out, the username is cleared from `sessionStorage` and the page reloads to reset the state.

```typescript
function getUserLogin() {
  return <div>
    <input
      type="text"
      placeholder="User name"
      defaultValue={userName}
      onKeyDown={(event) => {
        if (event.key === 'Enter') {
          let userName = (event.target as HTMLInputElement).value;
          window.sessionStorage.setItem('userName', userName);
          setUserName(userName);
          spreadSheetClient.userName = userName;
        }
      }} />
  </div>
}
```

### Document Management

* **Document Selection**: Once logged in, the user is presented with a list of documents fetched from the `spreadSheetClient`. Each document has an associated "Edit" button, which triggers the loading of the selected document by updating the URL and reloading the page.

## `SpreadSheet` Analysis

### State Management within SpreadSheet

The SpreadSheet component uses several useState hooks to manage the state of the spreadsheet:

* `formulaString`: Holds the current formula being entered or edited.
* `resultString`: Holds the result of the formula calculation.
* `cells`: Stores the display values of the spreadsheet cells.
* `statusString`: Manages the status of the current editing session (whether editing or not).
* `currentCell`: Tracks the currently selected cell.
* `currentlyEditing`: Indicates whether a cell is being edited or not.
* `userName`: Holds the userâ€™s name, fetched from sessionStorage.
* `serverSelected`: Allows the user to switch between different servers (default is "localhost").

### Event Handlers

The component contains several event handlers to manage user interactions:

* `onCommandButtonClick`: Handles the logic when command buttons (such as "edit", "clear", etc.) are clicked. It processes the button action and updates the spreadsheet accordingly.
* `onButtonClick`: Handles the number or parenthesis buttons during formula editing. When a button is clicked, it adds the corresponding value to the formula.
* `onCellClick`: Manages cell clicks. If the user is currently editing, it adds the cell's value to the formula. Otherwise, it updates the view to show the clicked cell.

### Interaction with `spreadSheetClient`

The `spreadSheetClient` is heavily utilized throughout the component for managing state and communicating with the backend:

* **Data fetching:** The client fetches the current formula, result, status, and cell values from the backend.
* **User and document management:** The client manages the user's name and the current document.
* **Command execution:** The client processes commands like editing, clearing, and token management, ensuring the backend reflects the changes.

### Return to Login Page

The component includes a function, `returnToLoginPage`, that allows the user to return to the login page by updating the URL and reloading the page. This resets the session and allows the user to select a new document.

```typescript
function returnToLoginPage() {
  spreadSheetClient.documentName = documentName;
  const href = window.location.href;
  const index = href.lastIndexOf('/');
  let newURL = href.substring(0, index);
  newURL = newURL + "/documents";
  window.history.pushState({}, '', newURL);
  window.location.reload();
}
```

## `SpreadSheetClient` Class Analysis

* The `SpreadSheetClient` class primarily implements the **`Facade pattern`**, providing a simplified interface for handling complex interactions between the frontend and backend. It abstracts away the details of network requests and document management, allowing React components to interact with the backend through easy-to-use methods.

* It also incorporates elements of the **`Proxy pattern`**, acting as an intermediary that manages communication with the server and document updates. While not explicitly a **`singleton`**, it shares some characteristics by centralizing the management of user and document state through a **single instance**.

## Backend Analysis

### `DocumentServer.ts` Analysis

This file defines the server-side functionality for managing documents using an Express server. The server provides a range of RESTful endpoints that interact with the `DocumentHolder` class, which manages the spreadsheet documents in memory.

#### Key Functionalities:

1. **Document Management:**
   - The server manages documents stored in the `DocumentHolder` class. Each document is represented as a `SpreadSheetController` object, allowing multiple users to interact with it concurrently.
   
2. **API Routes:**
   - The server defines several API routes to interact with documents, including:
     - `GET /documents`: Retrieves the list of available documents.
     - `PUT /documents/:name`: Creates or fetches a specific document based on the name provided.
     - `PUT /document/cell/edit/:name`: Requests edit access to a specific cell within a document.
     - `PUT /document/addtoken/:name`: Adds a token to the formula of the current cell.
     - `PUT /document/removetoken/:name`: Removes the last token from the formula of the current cell.
     - `PUT /document/clear/formula/:name`: Clears the current formula of the selected cell.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Each route includes basic error handling to ensure requests are correctly processed. For example, if a document does not exist, a 404 response is returned.

4. **Logging and Debugging:**
   - The server includes debug logging, which can be toggled on or off to help developers trace the flow of requests and identify potential issues during development.

### `DocumentHolder.ts` Analysis

`DocumentHolder` manages the collection of documents (`SpreadSheetController` instances). It handles the creation, modification, and retrieval of spreadsheet documents.

#### Key Functionalities:

1. **Document Storage:**
   - Documents are stored in a Map data structure, providing quick access and efficient management of multiple spreadsheets.

2. **Document Operations:**
   - The class provides methods to create new documents, save documents to the file system, and load documents from existing JSON data.

3. **Concurrency Control:**
   - It includes mechanisms to manage edit and view access requests from multiple users, ensuring data consistency and preventing conflicts.

4. **Error Management:**
   - The class includes robust error handling to manage invalid operations, such as accessing non-existent documents or circular dependencies between cells.

### `SpreadSheetController.ts` Analysis

The `SpreadSheetController` class is the core logic for managing spreadsheet operations. It handles interactions with the `SheetMemory`, which stores the state of each spreadsheet.

#### Key Functionalities:

1. **Cell Operations:**
   - The class manages adding, removing, and editing tokens within a cell's formula. It uses a `FormulaEvaluator` to compute the results of these formulas dynamically.

2. **Concurrency Handling:**
   - The controller manages multiple users editing and viewing cells, ensuring that only one user can edit a cell at any given time.

3. **Error Checking:**
   - It includes error checking for common issues such as circular dependencies, divide-by-zero errors, and invalid formulas.

### `FormulaEvaluator.ts` Analysis

`FormulaEvaluator` is responsible for parsing and evaluating cell formulas. It implements a recursive descent parser to handle arithmetic operations, unary and postfix operators, and cell references.

#### Key Functionalities:

1. **Arithmetic Parsing:**
   - The class supports parsing of basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), unary operators (negative values), and various mathematical functions (e.g., `sin`, `cos`).

2. **Error Management:**
   - Errors such as invalid formulas, divide-by-zero, and missing parentheses are identified and returned as part of the evaluation process.

3. **Integration with Sheet Memory:**
   - The evaluator fetches values directly from the `SheetMemory` class, ensuring that all calculations are based on the latest state of the spreadsheet.

## Integration Analysis

### Frontend-Backend Interaction

The Calc-Sheet project integrates the frontend and backend through a RESTful API, facilitating the seamless exchange of data and operations between the user interface and server-side logic.

#### Key Integration Points:

1. **Document Management:**
   - The frontend uses the `SpreadSheetClient` class to communicate with backend endpoints, such as fetching document data, editing cells, and updating formulas.

2. **Real-time Updates:**
   - The polling mechanism in `LoginPageComponent` ensures that the list of available documents is kept up-to-date in near real-time, enhancing user experience.

3. **Concurrency Control:**
   - The backend handles concurrent access and editing requests, ensuring data integrity and preventing conflicts during collaborative editing sessions.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Errors encountered during operations (e.g., invalid formulas, circular dependencies) are communicated back to the frontend and displayed to the user, enabling corrective actions.

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Routing Optimization:**
   - Replace the manual URL parsing in `App.tsx` with a robust routing library like `React Router` for better routing management.

2. **State Management Enhancement:**
   - Consider integrating a state management solution like `Redux` or `Context API` to manage global state more effectively, particularly as the application scales.

3. **Improved Error Feedback:**
   - Enhance the user feedback mechanism for errors, moving from simple alerts to more informative and user-friendly UI notifications.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Optimize backend performance by reducing the frequency of polling intervals or implementing WebSockets for real-time updates.

5. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure document access and ensure that only authorized users can edit or view specific cells.

## Conclusion

The Calc-Sheet project effectively combines React and Express to create a collaborative spreadsheet editing experience. The design showcases solid use of design patterns, concurrency management, and real-time user interaction. With some enhancements to routing, state management, and security, the project can be further improved to provide a robust and scalable solution.
